**In this project we use "Twine" , Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.**

1. First of all we write the scenario on paper , then we move to Twine where we start to create actions with multiple options.
2. Please Open the file Cold_Night_Scenario to read the whole script.
3. Please use Twine so you can see our "Graph" , what you have to do is easy just drag and drop the Cold_Night_Scenario file in Twine application or press on "Import from file " to open.
