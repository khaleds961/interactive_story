# Interactive_Story 
## This story is about our main character " Tom " who saw a crime and tried to help the victim .
**In this project we use "Twine" , Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories.**
1. First of all we write the scenario on paper , then we move to Twine where we start to create actions with multiple options.
2. If you use Twine you can see our graph , what you have to do is easy just drag and drop the html file in Twine application or press on "Import from file " to open. 
If you are not using "Twine" , we put two pictures as screen shots in our github repo so you can understand the actions we are talking about.
3. In End of the story the main character faces three options one of them is death. 
4. We build an HTML/CSS page as well to show you the process of the  in steps.
